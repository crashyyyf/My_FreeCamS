## How It Works

These scripts use Cheat Engine's **Auto Assembler (AA)** to inject custom assembly into the game's memory. We hook camera update functions and override position/rotation values manually.

## 🛠 Requirements

-  [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) (latest version recommended)
-  Some reverse engineering knowledge helps
